# Features

- Model Initialization: Initialize the CerebrasAI class with any supported model (llama3.1-8b, llama3.1-70b).
- Copy Chrome User Data: Automatically copies required Chrome user data for cookie-based authentication.
- API Key Management: Refreshes and updates the demo API key by fetching cookies and making an authenticated request to the Cerebras platform.
- Text Generation: Interact with Cerebras AI models to generate text completions, including streaming responses.
- Progress Tracking: Progress bars and terminal spinners for long-running operations.
- Error Handling: Built-in mechanisms to handle any type of error (e.g., connection issues, missing dependencies, invalid input) and provide meaningful error messages or fallback options.
# Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/sujalrajpoot/CerebrasAI.git
cd CerebrasAI
```

### Step 2: Install the required dependencies
- Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

### Step 1: Initialization
- You can initialize the CerebrasAI class with a specific model. Available models include llama3.1-8b and llama3.1-70b:

```python
from cerebras_ai import CerebrasAI

# Initialize with default model
ai = CerebrasAI()

# Initialize with a specific model
ai = CerebrasAI(model="llama3.1-70b")
```

### Generate AI Response
- You can ask questions to the AI using the ask method, which sends a message to the AI model and returns a response:

```python
response = ai.ask("What is the meaning of life?")
print(response)
```

# Project Structure
- cerebras_ai.py: The main code file containing the CerebrasAI class with all functionalities.
- requirements.txt: Contains all the dependencies required for the project.
- config.json: This file is generated automatically and stores the 
### API key and related information.

# Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Chrome WebDriver
- Selenium
- tqdm
- yaspin
- Cerebras SDK
- Requests
- Fake UserAgent
# How It Works
- Initialization: The class is initialized with the model. It checks for existing config files and copies Chrome user data if required.
- Cookie Fetching: The class uses Selenium to open a headless Chrome session, fetch the necessary cookies, and extract the demo API key.
- Asking Questions: Once the API key is set, users can interact with Cerebras models by asking questions using the ask method.

# Troubleshooting
- Chrome WebDriver Error: Ensure that you have the correct version of Chrome WebDriver installed. You can download it from here.
- API Key Expiration: If your demo API key expires, the program will automatically refresh it, but ensure that your Chrome user data is up-to-date.
